Create an API for usage of different modul loading and integration methods.
Current require of NodeModule is fixed coded. But we also want to use declarative
definitions, without automatically loading.
Example other loader:

* RequireLoader - loads by require
* ClassLoader - loads classes in files of a directory
* DeclarationLoader - load definitions
